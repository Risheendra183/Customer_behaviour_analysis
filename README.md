# Customer Behaviour Analysis

A professional, end-to-end data analytics portfolio project that mirrors real-world analyst responsibilities. This repository contains the full workflow from raw data to business-ready insights: data preparation, exploratory analysis, SQL-based analytics, interactive Power BI dashboards, and a final report/presentation.


Project overview
This project simulates a corporate-grade, end-to-end analytics workflow to translate raw retail/customer data into strategic, actionable business intelligence. Key goals:
- Prepare and clean raw transactional and customer data with Python.
- Explore customer behaviour patterns and segments (RFM, cohorts, churn risk).
- Load datasets into an SQL database and answer business questions via SQL queries.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate trends and recommendations.
- Produce a written report and presentation deck for stakeholders.

What this repo contains
- Python notebooks and scripts demonstrating data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model experiments (if any).
- Example SQL scripts to create tables, load data, and run analytical queries.
- A Power BI (.pbix) dashboard file to visualize insights interactively.
- A sample report and presentation template to summarize findings and recommendations.
